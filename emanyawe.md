## Git Question

**What is the difference between a git merge and a GitHub pull request?**

A git merge is a local Git operation that combines changes from one branch into another on a developer’s computer.

A GitHub pull request is a collaboration feature that allows someone to propose changes from one branch or fork and request that they be reviewed and merged through the GitHub website.
